Servlet config:
	- Servlet config is created by web container and it is used to read parameters from web
	- configuration available for each servlet independently in web.xml
	- getServletConfig() from request object
	
Servlet Context:
	- This is created by web container at the time deployment
	- This is application specific not servlet specific
	- getServletContext() used to get context object
	
Sessions in Servlet
	- Session is time interval inside the application
	- Session tracking/session management: the way of maintain user data inside the application.

There 4 techniques to track or manage the session
	- Cookies
		Cookie a small piece of information which we gonna to store at client machine
		There are two types cookies
			- Persistent cookie: It is available for multiple requests and it won't bbe clear from the browser as soon you closes it.
			- Non-Persistent cookie: It is available for single session and as soon closes the browser, it will clear from browser.
		Limitation in cookie	
			- less security because cookie stored in client machine i,e., browser
			- If user disable the cookie setting in browser, session won't work
	- Hidden from field
		Writing extra HTML element which is having value from the server for session management.
		
		Limitation
			-Less security because user can see the data in debug mode
			- unused HTML components loaded to view hence page becomes heavy.
	- URL Rewriting
		It means appending the exttra token or parameter to the URL
		Limitation
			- Less security
			- If get request has 255k data in URL then there is chance to loose data
	- HttpSession
		This session is maintained at server end
		Advantage:
			- It is more secure because session id are stored in server end
			- We can set value in key value format and check value against key
